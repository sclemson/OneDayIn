# One Day In...

## Project Overview
_One Day In…_ is a traveller’s companion - advising you of the best things to do with 24 hours in a given global city. The site strikes a balance between editorial advice and user recommendations and gives users the ability to post their own reviews of their favourite haunts, as well as being able to rate existing recommendations on the site. _One Day In..._ was a week-long group project in which I worked with [James Rogers](https://github.com/james92rogers) and [Kesh Gurung](github.com/keshgurung) to create our finished site.

## The Brief
- Build a full-stack application by making your own back-end and your own front-end.
- Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database.
- Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React. 
- Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models. 
- Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut.
- Be deployed online so it’s publicly accessible.

## First Steps
Our first discussions centred around the fact that we wanted to build something that would be genuinely useful to people and would have a central purpose that was different to other applications that we had used before. We focussed on travel as it was an area that we were all interested in and decided to create a site that blended editorial content with user interaction that would become a ‘go to’ place for advice for travellers looking to spend a day in any given global city.

It was important for us to design something that gave users a clear idea on our recommendations for a city, so we started by working out the key categories of recommendations that we would add to each city. The categories that we decided to focus on were Eat, Drink, Stay, See, Walk, and Secret, with the latter category being designed to highlight something in the given city that visitors may not have heard of. Additionally, we wanted to be able to highlight user recommendations and, as a result, we decided to build **CRUD** functionality into this area so that, as well as editorial recommandations, users would be able to post and rate their own ideas on essential places to visit.

## Day 1
_One Day In…_ was always conceived as being a genuinely useful app and we understood from the outset that we would need to focus on functionality and information in order to achieve this. In the first instance, our discussions (and subsequent pseudocode) revolved around getting our city models right - firstly by deciding on the type of information contained in each city, and then subsequently designing the schema that we would use. We used this information to wireframe the city pages and gain a clear idea of how the site would be laid out. Since the project was completed in a group of three we also decided to set up a Trello board to share resources and manage our workload (see below). Finally, we spent some time gathering our ‘dummy’ data - filling out our London schema in the first instance.
